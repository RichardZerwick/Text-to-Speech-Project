# Text-to-Speech-Project Development

This Text-to-Speech project aims to assist students in better understanding lecturers by offering a transcription of lessons by converting a lecturers voice to text. 

This is done by making use of OpenAI's Whisper library for the speech recognition and then training this model with transcriptions of the lecturers recorded lessons using Huggingface.
